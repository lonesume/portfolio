            Hi, I&apos;m Brian! I am a student at Valencia College
          </p>
          <p className="break-inside-avoid">
            I currently study Computer Science, with an emphasis on web
            development, both front-end and back-end, because I want to create
            websites and tools that make life easier, connect people in new
            ways, and help shape the future of how humans interact online.
          </p>
          <p className="break-inside-avoid">
            Currently, I work at The Shack, flexing my engineering prowess by
            meticulously crafting the finest delicacies for my loyal
            customersâ€”because nothing says &quot;future software engineer&quot;
            like optimizing the perfect cheese-to-burger ratio and debugging
            milkshake machines in record time.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="break-inside-avoid">
            In the future, I would like to work in big tech, specifically
            because I love how these companies are able to create innovative
            solutions that simplify and improve people&apos;s lives in so many
            ways.
          </p>
          <p className="break-inside-avoid">
            Also, outside of work and studying, I like to go to the gym, where I
            challenge myself physically and mentally, building discipline and
            resilience that carry over into all aspects of my life
